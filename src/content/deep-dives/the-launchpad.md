# The Launchpad
**Subtitle:** Lifecycle Automation & Onboarding Engine  
**Tags:** Automation • CRM • Lifecycle • Product-Led Growth

## Key Takeaways
- Replaced ad-hoc emails with a staged onboarding engine tied to events
- Mapped user states → nudges → outcomes; fewer manual tickets
- Lifted activation, reduced time-to-value, improved retention

## The Spark
Users were getting lost between purchase, onboarding, and first success. Support requests climbed; activation lagged.

## The Blueprint
- Modeled lifecycle states (New → Activated → Adopted → Champion)
- Orchestrated events via WP Fusion + CRM (purchases, course milestones, renewals)
- Designed playbooks for nudges (email, in-app cues, help docs, webinar invites)
- Connected analytics to lifecycle checkpoints for feedback

## The Impact
- ~70% reduction in support tickets (self-serve nudges + clarity)
- Higher onboarding completion; fewer refund requests
- Clear attribution for what nudges move cohorts forward

## Tech Stack

## Metrics to Watch
